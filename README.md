Clone the repo, and add your Private Key (Base58 string) and RPC to the config.py.

If you are using the new version of solana-py, use **send_legacy_transaction()** instead of **send_transaction()**.

### FAQS

**What format should my private key be in?**

The private key should be in the base58 string format, not bytes.

**Why are my transactions being dropped?**

You get what you pay for. Don't use the main-net RPC, just spend the money for Helius or Quick Node.

**How do I change the fee?**

Modify the UNIT_BUDGET and UNIT_PRICE in the config.py.

### Example

```
from pump_fun import buy

# Buy Example
mint_str = "pump_token_address"
sol_in = .1
slippage = 25
buy(mint_str, sol_in, slippage)
```

```
from pump_fun import sell

# Sell Example
mint_str = "pump_token_address"
percentage = 100
slippage = 25
sell(mint_str, percentage, slippage)
```
